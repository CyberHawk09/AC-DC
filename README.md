# AC/DC Anti-Fan
## by Conner Kam, Bruce Zhang, Walrian Zhang<br/>(Submission for Scrapyard Ottawa 2025 24-Hour Hackathon)
### Description
A circuitboard setup using a thermistor to measure temperature of its environment and update a DC motor with a fan's speed output to have a stronger cooling effect, the cooler it already is. When it is warmer, it will slow down/turn off the system.
Temperature in Celsius along with some splash text is shown on a liquid crystal display.
A short snippet of "Highway to Hell" by AC/DC is played on repeat in the background using a CHY 8 Ohm 1.5 Watt 28mm mini speaker.<br/>
### Power Specifications
AA batteries are required to power the motor and USB type C to USB type A connector is required to power the circuitboard (which powers the thermistor, LCD, speaker, etc. in turn).
